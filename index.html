  <h1>I Love Avocados😍</h1>
  <hr>
  <p>
    Avocados grow on a tree, Persea americana , that is native to the Western Hemisphere from Mexico south to the Andean regions.

  <h3>What Is an Avocado?</h3>
  <p>An avocado is a bright green fruit with a large pit and dark leathery skin. They’re also known as alligator
    pears or butter fruit. Avocados are a favorite of the produce section. They’re the go-to ingredient for guacamole dips.
    And they're turning up in everything from salads and wraps to smoothies and even brownies.
    So what, exactly, makes this pear-shaped berry (yes, that’s right!) such a superfood?</p>

  <h3>Avocado Nutrition</h3>
  <p>
    Avocados have a lot of calories. The recommended serving size is smaller than you’d expect: 1/3 of a medium avocado (50 grams or 1.7 ounces). One ounce has 50 calories.

    Avocados are high in fat. But it's monounsaturated fat, which is a "good" fat that helps lower bad cholesterol, as long as you eat them in moderation.

    Avocados offer nearly 20 vitamins and minerals. So in a 100-gram serving, you get:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>485 milligrams of potassium </li>
    <li>81 micrograms of folate</li>
    <li>0.257 milligrams of vitamin B6</li>
    <li>10 milligrams of vitamin C </li>
    <li>2.07 milligrams of vitamin E</li>
  </ul>
